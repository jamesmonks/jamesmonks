- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamesmonks
- 👀 I’m interested in relearning my craft after a prolonged absence. My last professional role was at a long-distance learning company called e4TN. I designed and developed flash games for students within TN to cover curriculums that some schools weren't able to provide.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, bootstrap
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-sourced projects that I find interesting or engaging.
- 📫 How to reach me ... well at present I'm doing the reaching out.
